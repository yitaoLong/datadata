1</b><br>Throughout this report "Mattel" refers to Mattel, Inc. and/or one or more of its subsidiaries. Mattel is a leading global toy and family entertainment company and owner of one of the most iconic brand portfolios in the world. Mattel creates innovative products and experiences that inspire fans, entertain audiences, and develop children through play. Mattel is focused on the following evolved strategy to grow its intellectual property ("IP") driven toy business and expand its entertainment offering:<br><b>Paragraph 2</b><br>•Grow toy business profitably through scaling Mattel's portfolio, optimizing operations, evolving demand creation, and growing franchise brands; and<br><b>Paragraph 3</b><br>•Expand entertainment offering to capture the full value of Mattel's IP outside the toy aisle in highly accretive business verticals, by growing franchise brands and accelerating content, consumer products, and digital and live experiences.<br><b>Paragraph 4</b><br>Mattel is the owner of a portfolio of iconic brands and partners with global entertainment companies to license other IP. Mattel's portfolio of owned and licensed brands and products are organized into the following categories:<br><b>Paragraph 5</b><br>Infant, Toddler, and Preschool—including brands such as Fisher-Price (including Little People and Imaginext) and Thomas & Friends. As a leader in play and child development, Fisher-Price's mission is to help families by making the most fun, enriching products for infants, toddlers, and preschoolers. Thomas & Friends is an award-winning preschool train brand franchise that brings meaningful life lessons of friendship and teamwork to kids through toys, content, live events, and other consumer products.<br><b>Paragraph 6</b><br>Vehicles—including brands such as Hot Wheels (including Hot Wheels Monster Trucks and Hot Wheels Mario Kart (Nintendo)), Matchbox, and Cars (Disney Pixar). In production for over 50 years, Hot Wheels continues to push the limits of performance and design, and ignites and nurtures the challenger spirit of kids, adults, and collectors. From die-cast vehicles to tracks, playsets, and accessories, the Mattel Vehicles portfolio has broad appeal that engages and excites fans of all ages.<br><b>Paragraph 7</b><br>Action Figures, Building Sets, Games, and Other—including brands such as Masters of the Universe, MEGA, UNO, Jurassic World (NBCUniversal), Minecraft (Microsoft), WWE, and Star Wars (Disney's Lucasfilm). Mattel's Action Figures portfolio is comprised of product lines associated with licensed entertainment franchises, such as Jurassic World and WWE, as well as product lines from Mattel-owned IP, such as Masters of the Universe. As the challenger brand in Building Sets, MEGA inspires creativity through authentic building experiences for builders of all ages and fans of global franchises. Within Games, UNO is the classic matching card game that is easy to learn and fast fun for everyone. Other includes Plush, which contains products associated with movie releases from licensed entertainment franchises, as well as Mattel-owned IP.<br><b>Paragraph 8</b><br>Barbie continues to deliver innovation, purpose-driven marketing campaigns, and engaging toys connected to a strong system of play. Barbie has broad product offerings, with product lines designed to appeal to children of multiple age groups, complemented by a Barbie Signature line with high-quality dolls that appeal to fans of all ages. In 2024, Barbie will look to continue to capitalize on the successful live action theatrical movie to help drive the full Barbie franchise, including toys, consumer products, and gaming. Barbie will be celebrating its 65th anniversary with numerous activations, and also launch exciting new product lines and play patterns.<br><b>Paragraph 9</b><br>In 2024, Fisher-Price will continue its focus on engaging consumers as a trusted partner for families with infants, toddlers and preschoolers, by continuing to create brand love through innovative products and enriching the first five years of childhood for every family. Consumer-centric innovation will continue to drive new product offerings, including the expansion of Linked Play within Infant and new innovative toys from Imaginext, including new licensed entertainment offerings. Fisher-Price will add Fisher-Price Wood and continue its strong momentum in the Little People product line with the expansion of the Little People Barbie line and Little People Collector line.<br><b>Paragraph 10</b><br>In 2024, industry leader Hot Wheels will look to continue its strong momentum as a multigenerational franchise with consumer interest that remains at historic highs. Hot Wheels product offerings are expected to excite consumers with innovation in both die-cast vehicles and tracks and playsets. These offerings will be supported by an all-new animated children's series on Netflix, Hot Wheels Let’s Race, and the expansion of the Hot Wheels Racerverse line. Hot Wheels also seeks to further expand die-cast vehicle distribution, targeting fans of all ages.<br><b>Paragraph 11</b><br>Die-cast pioneer Matchbox expects to continue to bring exciting new products to market following its successful 70th anniversary, including new sustainable die-cast products, and new episodes of the globally popular YouTube series, Matchbox Adventures.<br><b>Paragraph 12</b><br>Action Figures, Building Sets, Games, and Other<br><b>Paragraph 13</b><br>Mattel Action Figures will continue to collaborate with key licensor partners, such as Disney Pixar, Microsoft, NBCUniversal, and WWE, to bring innovative products to the global marketplace. Mattel's 2024 Action Figures product lines will include toys tied to Netflix content for NBCUniversal’s Jurassic World (Jurassic World: Chaos Theory) and Masters of the Universe (Masters of the Universe: Revolution) as well as new innovation within Minecraft and WWE.<br><b>Paragraph 14</b><br>Mattel Games consists of some of the most beloved Games IP in the world including UNO, Pictionary, Skip-Bo, Blokus, and many others. Mattel will focus on its expansion of Games into its direct-to-consumer business, collectability, and innovation. Additionally, Mattel expects to introduce new game extensions and partnerships that celebrate pop culture.<br><b>Paragraph 15</b><br>Mattel is a worldwide leader in the manufacture, marketing, and sale of toys, games, and other products related to play, learning, and development. Competition in the toy industry is based primarily on quality, play value, brands, and price. Mattel offers a diverse range of products for children, fans of all ages, and families that include, among others, toys for infants, toddlers, and preschoolers, toys for school-aged children, dolls, vehicles, action figures, building sets, games, including digital, puzzles, plush, educational toys, technology-related products, media-driven products, and fashion-related items. The North America segment competes with several large toy companies, including Hasbro, Jazwares, LEGO, the Pokémon Company, Spin Master, many smaller toy companies, and manufacturers of video games and consumer electronics. The International segment competes with global toy companies including Hasbro, Jazwares, LEGO, the Pokémon Company, Spin Master, other national and regional toy companies, and manufacturers of video games and consumer electronics. Foreign regions may include competitors that are strong in a particular toy line or geographical area but do not compete with Mattel or other international toy companies worldwide. The American Girl segment competes with companies that manufacture dolls and accessories, and with children's book publishers and retailers.<br><b>Paragraph 16</b><br>There is increasing competition among the above companies due to trends towards shorter life cycles for individual toy products and an increasing use of more sophisticated technology among consumers. In addition, Mattel competes with companies that sell non-toy products, such as electronic consumer products, video games, as well as content and other entertainment companies. Competition continues to be heavily influenced by the fact that a small number of retailers account for a large portion of all toy sales, allocate the shelf space from which toys are viewed, and have direct contact with parents and children through in-store and online purchases. Such retailers can and do promote their own private-label toys, facilitate the sale of competitors' toys, showcase toys online based on proprietary algorithms, and allocate shelf space to one type of toy over another. Online distributors are able to promote a wide variety of toys and represent a wide variety of toy manufacturers.<br><b>Paragraph 17</b><br>Mattel has entered into agreements to license entertainment properties, including among others, Disney Consumer Products (including Disney Princess and Disney Frozen, Star Wars, Disney Pixar (including Cars and Toy Story) and certain other Disney films and television properties), NBCUniversal (including Jurassic World, Trolls, and Fast and Furious), Paramount (relating to its Nickelodeon properties), Warner Bros. (including DC Universe and Harry Potter), Microsoft (including Minecraft and Halo), WWE, and Pokémon.<br><b>Paragraph 18</b><br>Mattel's business and operating results depend largely upon the appeal of its products, driven by both innovation and marketing. Consumer preferences, particularly with children as the end users of Mattel's products, are continuously changing and can vary by geographical markets. Product life cycles and consumer preferences continue to be affected by the rapidly increasing use and proliferation of social and digital media by consumers, and the speed with which information is shared. Mattel is not always able to identify trends in consumer preferences or identify and satisfy consumer preferences in a timely manner. Significant, sudden shifts in demand are caused by "hit" toys and trends, which are often unpredictable and can result in short consumer life cycles. Mattel offers a diverse range of products for children, fans of all ages, and families that includes, among others, toys for infants, toddlers, and preschoolers, toys for school-aged children, youth electronics, digital media, hand-held and other games, puzzles, educational toys, and fashion-related items. Mattel competes domestically and internationally with a wide range of large and small manufacturers, marketers, and sellers of toys, video games, consumer electronics such as tablets and mobile devices, and other play products, as well as retailers, which means that Mattel's market position is always at risk. Mattel's ability to maintain its current product sales and increase its product sales or establish product sales with new, innovative toys, depends on Mattel's ability to satisfy play preferences, enhance existing products, develop and introduce new products, and achieve market acceptance of these products. These challenges are intensifying due to trends towards shorter life cycles for individual toy products, the phenomenon of children outgrowing traditional toys at younger ages, an increasing use of more sophisticated technology in toys, including machine learning and artificial intelligence ("AI"), and an evolving path to purchase.<br><b>Paragraph 19</b><br>In addition, entertainment media has become increasingly important for consumers to experience Mattel's brands and its license partners' brands. The extent to which Mattel's and its license partners' entertainment offerings are successful can significantly impact the demand for Mattel's products and its financial performance. Consumer acceptance of Mattel's and its license partners' entertainment offerings is impacted by factors beyond its control, including critical reviews, promotions, the popularity of movies and television programs released into the marketplace at or near the same time, the availability of alternative forms of entertainment, general economic conditions, and public preferences generally.<br><b>Paragraph 20</b><br>Mattel's failure to successfully meet the challenges outlined above in a timely and cost-effective manner could decrease demand for its products and entertainment offerings and may adversely affect Mattel's business, financial condition, and results of operations.<br><b>Paragraph 21</b><br>Mattel faces competitors who are also constantly monitoring and attempting to anticipate consumer tastes, seeking ideas which will appeal to consumers, and introducing new products that compete with Mattel's products. In addition, competition for access to entertainment properties has lessened, and may in the future continue to lessen, Mattel's ability to secure, maintain, and renew popular licenses to entertainment products developed by other parties and licensed to Mattel on beneficial terms, if at all, or require Mattel to pay licensors higher royalties and higher minimum guaranteed payments to obtain or retain these licenses. As a licensee of entertainment properties, Mattel has no guarantee that a particular property or brand will translate into a successful toy, game, or other product. In addition, the barriers to entry for new participants in the toy products industry and<br><b>Paragraph 22</b><br>entertainment industry are low. In a very short period of time, new market participants with a popular product idea or entertainment property can become a significant source of competition for Mattel and its products. Reduced demand for Mattel's brands, products, and product lines as a result of these factors may adversely affect Mattel's business, financial condition, and results of operations.<br><b>Paragraph 23</b><br>Successful movies, television programs, video games, and characters in children's literature affect play preferences, and many products depend on media-based intellectual property licenses including trademarks, trade names, copyrights, patents, trade secrets, and rights under intellectual property license agreements and other agreements with third parties. Media-based licenses can cause a line of toys or other products to gain immediate success among children, parents, or families. Trends in media, and children's characters change swiftly and contribute to the transience and uncertainty of play preferences. Mattel attempts to respond to such trends and developments by modifying, refreshing, extending, and expanding its product offerings on an annual basis.<br><b>Paragraph 24</b><br>Mattel spends considerable resources in designing and developing toys and other products based on its and its license partners' planned content releases. Mattel also relies heavily on the efforts of third parties, such as studios and other content creators and distributors, with respect to the development of content, marketing support, and release dates, which has an impact on the success of such content and the associated toys and other products. In many cases, Mattel does not fully control when or if any particular project will be greenlit, developed, or released. Third parties may change their plans with respect to projects and release dates, or may decide to cancel development. Other developments, such as labor strikes or theater closures, have at times caused, and could in the future cause, delays in the release of new movies and television programs, and any such delay or cancellation may adversely impact Mattel’s sales of the associated toys and other products.<br><b>Paragraph 25</b><br>Mattel expects that children will continue to be interested in product offerings incorporating sophisticated technology, such as video games, consumer electronics, and social and digital media, at increasingly younger ages. To the extent Mattel seeks to introduce sophisticated technology products, such products tend to have higher design, development, and production costs, follow longer timelines, and require different competencies compared to Mattel's more traditional toys and games. The pace of change in product offerings and consumer tastes for sophisticated technology products is potentially even greater than for Mattel's more traditional products, and consequently the window for consumer interest in such products may be shorter than for traditional toys and games.<br><b>Paragraph 26</b><br>Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements<br><b>Paragraph 27</b><br>Mattel is required to provide standby letters of credit to support certain obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business and may choose to provide letters of credit in place of posting cash collateral. Although the letters of credit are off-balance sheet, the majority of the obligations to which they relate are reflected as liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. Outstanding letters of credit totaled approximately $9 million and $8 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.<br><b>Paragraph 28</b><br>Commitments<br><b>Paragraph 29</b><br>In the normal course of business, Mattel enters into contractual arrangements to obtain and protect Mattel's right to create and market certain products, and for future purchases of goods and services, including for the purchase of future inventory to ensure availability of materials. These arrangements include commitments for royalty payments pursuant to licensing agreements, which routinely contain provisions for guarantees or minimum expenditures during the terms of the contracts. Mattel also enters into long-term debt arrangements that include periodic interest and principal payments. Mattel also has defined benefit and postretirement benefit plans, which require future cash contributions and benefit payments. Additionally, Mattel routinely enters into noncancelable lease agreements for premises and equipment used, which contain minimum rental payments.<br><b>Paragraph 30</b><br>41<br><b>Paragraph 31</b><br>The following table summarizes Mattel's contractual commitments and obligations:<br><b>Paragraph 32</b><br><table

(“Hasbro”) is a toy and game company whose mission is to entertain and connect generations of fans through the wonder of storytelling and exhilaration of play. We are Creating Magic Through Play by delivering engaging brand experiences for global audiences across gaming, consumer products and entertainment, with a portfolio of iconic brands including MAGIC: THE GATHERING, Hasbro Gaming, PLAY-DOH, NERF, TRANSFORMERS, DUNGEONS & DRAGONS, and PEPPA PIG, as well as premier partner brands.<br><b>Paragraph 34</b><br>Fiscal year 2023 was a year of transformation for our business. Following the October 2022 announcement of our revised strategic plan, we embarked upon an ambitious, multi-year transformation guided by our revamped strategy. Since that announcement, we have been able to create efficiencies in our supply chain, improve our inventory position, lower our costs, and reinvest back into the business. During fiscal 2023, we strengthened our leadership team with industry veterans and turnaround experts and have focused our strategic investments on our most valuable and profitable franchises across games, toys, licensing and entertainment. This focused strategy also led to the decision to sell certain non-core parts of our business, including the Entertainment One film and television business not relating to Hasbro and family-oriented brands, which we refer to as Hasbro Brands and Family Brands. In 2023, we experienced stronger than expected market headwinds within our Consumer Products business, resulting in our difficult decision to take additional headcount reductions and accelerate the process of certain organizational structure changes that is expected to result in the reallocation of people and resources, both in effort to strengthen our foundation and position Hasbro for growth.<br><b>Paragraph 35</b><br>On April 12, 2023, we also announced the appointment of industry veteran Tim Kilpin as President, Toys, Licensing & Entertainment, effective April 24, 2023. Mr. Kilpin joined Hasbro from PlayMonster Group, LLC, where he served as Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Previously, Mr. Kilpin held senior leadership positions within the toy and entertainment industry at companies that include Activision Blizzard, Inc., Mattel, Inc. and The Walt Disney Company.<br><b>Paragraph 36</b><br>For DUNGEONS & DRAGONS, we activated multiple parts of our Blueprint, including through the release of Baldur’s Gate 3, the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS-based role-playing video game, the theatrical release of Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves and the continued integration of D&D Beyond, the premier digital content platform for DUNGEONS & DRAGONS acquired during the second quarter of 2022. Baldur's Gate 3, released in the third quarter of 2023 from our partners at Larian Studios, has won six awards, including Game of the Year at the 10th annual Game Awards.<br><b>Paragraph 37</b><br>We experienced success through the out-license of certain of our brands to other third-party digital game developers who transform Hasbro brand-based characters and other intellectual properties into digital gaming experiences. One example is the popular free-to-play mobile game, Monopoly Go!, released by Scopely, Inc. during 2023 and based on the classic MONOPOLY board game. Monopoly Go! surpassed $1.0 billion in revenue in 2023, from which we receive digital licensing royalties.<br><b>Paragraph 38</b><br>Going forward, we retained brand-based created content and the capability to develop and produce entertainment including animation, digital shorts, scripted TV and theatrical films related to core Hasbro IP as well as our Family Brands business, such as PEPPA PIG and PJ MASKS.<br><b>Paragraph 39</b><br>Our mission is to entertain and connect generations of fans through the wonder of storytelling and exhilaration of play. We are "Creating Magic Through Play". Our strategic plan, which we refer to as our Blueprint or Blueprint 2.0, supports our mission by bringing compelling and expansive brand experiences to consumers and audiences around the world. Using this approach, our brands are transformed as story-led and play-led consumer franchises brought to life through games, play and experiences and offered across a multitude of platforms and media. Our commitment to disciplined, strategic investments, differentiates Hasbro as a purpose-driven business with diversified capabilities focused on driving long-term, sustainable and profitable growth and enhancing shareholder value.<br><b>Paragraph 40</b><br>•Build innovative toys and games that create memorable, social and collectible experiences of play and entertainment in our key focus categories: games (board games, trading cards, role playing); preschool; action brands; creativity; outdoor; and dolls.<br><b>Paragraph 41</b><br>•Focus on a franchise-first approach to deliver the magic of our brands through licensing, digital games and entertainment.<br><b>Paragraph 42</b><br>•Entertainment investments focused on Hasbro IP aligned with our strategic plan, including merchandise and digital engagement opportunities with a focus on franchise brands.<br><b>Paragraph 43</b><br>•Invest in our Hasbro direct-to-consumer business and build direct relationships with fans through ecommerce, social, digital games and services.<br><b>Paragraph 44</b><br>•Continue to cultivate our digital gaming business, through AAA games, games as a service and licensing relationships that activate our brands.<br><b>Paragraph 45</b><br>•Scale licensing of our brands through a growing portfolio of partners from theme park operators to toy companies, for consumers to experience our brands and drive communities of friendship and fandom around them.<br><b>Paragraph 46</b><br>Hasbro's purpose of creating joy and community for all people around the world, one game, one toy, one story at a time starts with consumers and our fans, who represent multigenerational audiences that sit at the center of our strategy. Understanding our fans, expanding our fan base and delivering for them is the key driver behind our evolution as a brand-driven toy and game company. The development and execution of our brands are informed by our brand insights platform, a proprietary consumer insights and data analytics system which helps us understand the behavior of our consumers. We have learned that consumers will travel with a brand that they love across multiple forms and formats, including our core historical strength of toys and games and licensed consumer products, as well as digital gaming and story-led entertainment and experiences.<br><b>Paragraph 47</b><br>•Toys and Games. We market and sell toys and games based on our owned and controlled brands globally at retail stores, through ecommerce platforms and through our fan-based direct-to-consumer platforms Hasbro PULSE and SECRET LAIR. Additionally, through license agreements with third parties, we develop and sell products based on popular third-party brands through these channels. Our toys and games include action figures, arts and crafts and creative play products, dolls, play sets, preschool toys, plush products, sports action blasters and accessories, vehicles and toy-related specialty products, games and many other consumer products which represent an array of internationally recognizable brands that capture the imagination of our consumers worldwide.<br><b>Paragraph 48</b><br>Within toys and games, as a leading producer of new and innovative gaming brands and play experiences, our gaming business continues to transform game play. To successfully execute our gaming strategy, we consider brands which capitalize on existing trends while evolving our approach using consumer insights and data analytics, technology advancements and offering game-play experiences addressed to consumer demand for face-to-face, trading card and digital game experiences played as board, off-the-board, digital, card, electronic, trading card and role-playing games. Our goal is to create innovative toys and games that create memorable and magical moments that last a lifetime.<br><b>Paragraph 49</b><br>Our subsidiary, Wizards of the Coast (“Wizards”), is a critical part of our gaming business, driving innovation and growth through its popular role-playing and fantasy card-collecting games such as MAGIC: THE GATHERING, Hasbro's first billion-dollar brand which benefited from multiple tentpole set releases exceeding $100.0 million per set during 2023, and DUNGEONS & DRAGONS. Our iconic game brands include long-time favorites such as MONOPOLY, JENGA, CONNECT 4, THE GAME OF LIFE, SCRABBLE, CLUE and TRIVIAL PURSUIT, as well as many other well-known game brands.<br><b>Paragraph 50</b><br>•Licensed Consumer Products. As a complement to our toy and game business, we promote our brands through the out-licensing of our intellectual properties to third parties for promotional and merchandising uses in a wide range of consumer products. These include apparel, publishing, home goods and electronics, or in certain situations, toy products where the out-licensing of brands is more effective and profitable than developing and marketing the products ourselves. A recent example of this includes the return of our LITTLEST PET SHOP brand through our partnership with Basic Fun!, a global marketer of toys and consumer products. Together we relaunched LITTLEST PET SHOP through a Roblox<br><b>Paragraph 51</b><br>experience in December 2023 and expect a refreshed LITTLEST PET SHOP product lineup in the first half of 2024 featuring new characters, collectables, and play-sets. We also out-license our brands for uses in theme park attractions and other forms of location-based entertainment. In cases where we license our intellectual property to a third party, we enter into contracts with licensees that pay us either a sales-based or usage-based royalty, or a combination of both, for use of the brands, and, in some cases, the license arrangements are subject to minimum guaranteed amounts or fixed fees, over the term of the license.<br><b>Paragraph 52</b><br>•Digital Gaming. Important to our success is the continued growth and development of our digital gaming business, including development of AAA games, games as a service and licensed games. Spanning action role-playing games for web-based play, PC and gaming consoles, to Hasbro branded mobile application-based games, our digital gaming business helps to unlock the full value of our brands and achieve our mission of storytelling and bringing our brands to life. Recent examples include the 2023 release of Baldur's Gate 3, the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS-based role-playing video game from our partners at Larian Studios which won six awards, including Game of the Year at the 10th annual Game Awards. In 2022, we acquired D&D Beyond, the premier digital content platform for DUNGEONS & DRAGONS. In addition, we continue to develop and enhance other digital games internally and through third parties. For example, we have developed and launched the digital version of the MAGIC: THE GATHERING card game, Magic: The Gathering Arena and its related mobile application, both of which complement the Company's direct-to-customer relationships with our new and long-time, MAGIC: THE GATHERING fan-base. We also out-license certain of our brands to other third-party digital game developers who transform Hasbro brand-based characters and other intellectual properties into digital gaming experiences such as Baldur's Gate 3. One example is the popular Monopoly Go! free-to-play mobile game, released by Scopely, Inc. during 2023 and based on the classic board game, MONOPOLY.<br><b>Paragraph 53</b><br>•Entertainment. Reinforcing storylines associated with our owned and controlled Hasbro and Family Brands through entertainment mediums, including television, film, digital content and other programming is our primary entertainment strategy. With our cross-platform capabilities our entertainment business leverages film and television production and sales, digital content and children's programming to create compelling entertainment and drive creativity and overall awareness across brands with merchandising and licensing tie-ins.<br><b>Paragraph 54</b><br>◦Film and Television. Our go-forward primary focus is on the development, production and co-production of content based upon Hasbro brands. Our film content is offered on all media channels, including cinema, home entertainment, broadcast and digital, including Subscription Video‑On‑Demand ("SVOD").<br><b>Paragraph 55</b><br>•Other Elements of our Strategy. Other aspects of our strategy that help drive our storytelling experiences include digital content, location-based entertainment, and publishing.<br><b>Paragraph 56</b><br>◦Digital Content. We understand the importance of digital content to drive fan engagement, including in gaming and across other media, and of integrating such content with our products. Digital media encompasses digital gaming applications and the creation of digital environments for traditional products through the use of complementary digital applications, social media and websites which extend storylines and enhance play.<br><b>Paragraph 57</b><br>◦Location-Based Entertainment. Location-based entertainment (“LBE”) allows consumers to experience and share our brands. LBE includes licensing our brands to theme parks, water parks, hotels and resorts, family entertainment centers, retail, dining and entertainment, shows, exhibits and exhibitions such as Hasbro City, the newly-opened Hasbro-themed family entertainment center located in Paseo Interlomas, Mexico featuring thrilling theme park rides and experiences, live shows, food and beverage options and the region's first Hasbro-themed retail location. These experiences bring our brands to life and further immerse our consumers in our storytelling in a capital efficient manner.<br><b>Paragraph 58</b><br>•Entertainment<br><b>Paragraph 59</b><br><table style="border-collapse:collapse;display:inline-table;margin-bottom:5pt;vertical-align:text-bottom;width:100.000%"><tr><td style="width:1.0%"></td><td style="width:13.980%"></td><td style="width:0.1%"></td><td style="width:1.0%"></td><td style="width:83.820%"></td><td style="width:0.1%"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3" style="border-left:1pt solid #000000;border-top:1pt solid #000000;padding:2px 1pt;text-align:left;vertical-align:top"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:700;line-height:115%;text-decoration:underline">Segment</span></td><td colspan="3" style="border-left:1pt solid #000000;border-right:1pt solid #000000;border-top:1pt solid #000000;padding:2px 1pt;text-align:left;vertical-align:top"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:700;line-height:115%;text-decoration:underline">Description of Segment</span></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3" style="border-left:1pt solid #000000;border-top:1pt solid #000000;padding:2px 1pt;text-align:left;vertical-align:top"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:115%">Consumer Products</span></td><td colspan="3" style="border-left:1pt solid #000000;border-right:1pt solid #000000;border-top:1pt solid #000000;padding:2px 1pt;text-align:left;vertical-align:top"><div style="margin-top:6pt;padding-left:36pt;text-indent:-18pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">•</span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%;padding-left:14.5pt">Engages in the sourcing, marketing and sales of toy and game products around the world.

Rights to such designs and ideas, when acquired or licensed by us, are usually exclusive for<br><b>Paragraph 61</b><br>We also produce an array of products under licenses based on our partners’ trademarks and copyrights for the names or likenesses of characters from movies, television shows and other entertainment media. We compete with other toy and game manufacturers for these licensed rights, and we refer to our products produced under these arrangements as Partner Brands. Licensing fees for these rights are generally paid as a royalty on our net sales of the item. Licenses for the use of characters may be exclusive for specific products or product lines in specified territories, or may be non-exclusive, in which case our product offerings may be competing with the product offerings of other licensees. In many instances, advance royalties and minimum guarantees are required by these license agreements. Our royalty expense in any given year may vary depending upon product mix and the timing of movie releases and other entertainment media.<br><b>Paragraph 62</b><br>Additionally, we promote our brands through the out-licensing of our intellectual properties to third parties for promotional and merchandising uses in a wide range of consumer products, where the out-licensing of brands is more effective and profitable than developing and marketing the products ourselves. We also out-license our brands for uses in theme park attractions and other forms of location-based entertainment. Under these agreements, licensees either pay us a sales-based or usage-based royalty, or a combination of both, for use of our brands, and, in some cases, the license arrangements are subject to minimum guaranteed amounts or fixed fees, over the term of the license.<br><b>Paragraph 63</b><br>As described earlier, our strategy includes focusing on reinforcing storylines associated with our brands through several mediums, including digital and tabletop gaming, consumer products, television, film and live action experiences. Our brands obtain marketing and advertising support through entertainment appearing on major<br><b>Paragraph 64</b><br>networks globally, theatrical releases as well as on various other digital platforms, such as Netflix and Apple TV. A recent example of this was the September 2023 premier of the television series, Power Rangers Cosmic Fury season 30, released on the Netflix streaming platform.<br><b>Paragraph 65</b><br>Many of our new toy and game products are introduced to major customers within one to two years leading up to their year of retail introduction. Our advertising expenditures are impacted by our product mix in any given year. For example, brands based on major motion picture releases generally require less advertising as a result of the promotional activities around the motion picture release, whereas leading into a major digital gaming launch, our Wizards of the Coast business will have substantial increases to advertising, marketing and promotional expenses to acquire players and promote gaming releases.<br><b>Paragraph 66</b><br>We are a worldwide leader in the development, design, sale and marketing of toys and games and entertainment offerings, operating in a highly competitive business environment. We compete with several large toy and game companies in our product categories, as well as with many smaller United States and international toy and game designers, manufacturers and marketers. In certain instances, we also compete with large retailers, who offer such products under their own private labels, often at lower prices. In addition, we compete with digital gaming developers, some of which focus primarily on digital gaming products and services made available for gaming consoles, personal computers and mobile devices. We compete with other companies that offer TV and film content and branded entertainment specific to children and their families. Given the ease of entry into our business, we view our primary competition as coming from toy and game companies, digital gaming developers and content providers who are creating play and entertainment experiences that compete with our brand-driven storytelling and product experiences for consumer attention and spending. Businesses that create compelling content have the potential to translate that content into a full range of product offerings. Competition is based primarily on meeting consumer preferences and on the quality and play value of our products and experiences. To a lesser extent, competition is also based on product pricing.<br><b>Paragraph 67</b><br>Our entertainment business competes with other companies that produce and distribute films, television programs and other entertainment content. Many of the major U.S. studios are part of large, diversified corporate groups with a variety of other operations, including television networks and cable channels that can provide both in-house<br><b>Paragraph 68</b><br>In addition to contending with competition from other toy and game and entertainment and storytelling companies, we contend with the expanding variety of digital gaming and digital entertainment offerings available for children, while product life cycles of traditional toys and games have shortened. As a result, our products not only compete with those offerings produced by other toy and game manufacturers and companies offering branded family play and entertainment, we also compete, particularly in meeting the demands of older children, with entertainment offerings of many technology companies, such as makers of tablets, mobile devices, video games and other digital gaming products and screens, and social media companies.<br><b>Paragraph 69</b><br>The changing trends in consumer preferences with respect to entertainment and low barriers to entry as well as the emergence of new technologies, such as artificial intelligence, and different mediums for viewing content, such as the growing number of streaming platform options, continually creates new opportunities for existing competitors and start-ups to develop products and offerings that compete with our entertainment and toy and game offerings.<br><b>Paragraph 70</b><br>A key component to the success of our strategy is to continue to innovate, develop and invest in digital gaming, particularly through our Wizards of the Coast and digital gaming business. We have invested substantially in this business and as a result it has seen significant growth over the past several years. Continued digital game development is a key growth factor for the future, including AAA games, games as a service and licensed games. If we are unable to continue to grow this business and ensure its integration with our other business segments, our business may be harmed. The digital gaming industry is highly competitive, including for talent, and costs associated with designing, developing and producing digital games and technologically advanced or sophisticated products tend to be higher than for many of our other more traditional products, such as board and trading card games and action figures, with no assurance of success. As a result, we face increased risk of not achieving sales sufficient to recover our costs and we may lose money on the development and sale of these products. Additionally, designing, developing and producing digital gaming and other technologically advanced or innovative products often relies on third parties and requires different competencies and follows different timelines than traditional toys and games. Delays in the design, development or production of our digital gaming products could have a significant impact on our success. In addition, the pace of change in product offerings and consumer tastes in the electronics and digital gaming areas is potentially even greater than for our other products and this pace of change is expected to accelerate as artificial intelligence is further incorporated into the development of games. If a digital game fails to gain consumer acceptance early in its life cycle, there are limited opportunities to gain such acceptance through secondary launches or distribution through alternative platforms. This pace of change or lack of consumer acceptance means that the window in which a digital gaming product can achieve and maintain consumer interest may be even shorter than traditional toys and games.<br><b>Paragraph 71</b><br>The entertainment industry continues to experience frequent change driven by technological development and audience viewing preferences, including developments with respect to the formats through which films, television programming, and other episodic content are delivered to consumers. With rapid technological changes and expanded digital content offerings, the scale and scope of these changes have accelerated in recent years. Consumers are continuing to increase their access to television, film and other episodic content on streaming and digital content networks. Similarly, some film releases go direct to streaming channels as opposed to theaters or at the same time as theaters or have gone to streaming channels after only a short period of time in the theaters.<br><b>Paragraph 72</b><br>Technological as well as other trends in the industry have caused significant disruption to the retail distribution of entertainment offerings and have caused, and could in the future cause, a negative impact on sales of our products and other forms of monetization of content, especially those which are reliant on box office success. We may lose opportunities to capitalize on changing market dynamics, technological innovations or consumer tastes if we do not adapt to such changes in a timely manner. The overall effect that technological development and new digital distribution platforms have on the revenue and profits we derive from our entertainment content, including from merchandise sales derived from such content, and the additional costs associated with changing markets, media platforms and technologies, is unpredictable. If we fail to accurately assess and effectively respond to changes in technology and consumer behavior in the entertainment industry, our business may be harmed.<br><b>Paragraph 73</b><br>The play industry is highly competitive. We compete in the U.S. and internationally with a wide array of large and small manufacturers, marketers, and sellers of toys and games, products which combine traditional and digital play, digital gaming products, and other consumer products, as well as with retailers who offer such products under their own private labels often at lower prices. In addition, we compete with companies focused on building their brands across multiple product and consumer categories, including through entertainment offerings. Across our business, we face competitors who are constantly monitoring and attempting to anticipate consumer tastes and trends, seeking ideas which will appeal to consumers, and introducing new products that compete with our products for consumer acceptance and purchase.<br><b>Paragraph 74</b><br>Our entertainment business, which following the sale of our eOne film and television business is primarily focused on Hasbro and family-oriented content, faces global competition from major film studios and television production companies as well as other independent distributors and independent content producers. Many of these competitors release a large number of content offerings annually and command a significant share of box office revenues, streaming revenues, and television airtime, as well as other independent film and television production or distribution companies. Some of these competitors have substantially greater marketing and financial resources than we do and may be able to compete aggressively on pricing in order to increase box office or streaming revenues, obtain distribution rights and obtain television airtime. The competition we face may cause us to lose market share or achieve lower prices for productions based on our intellectual property, which could harm our business.<br><b>Paragraph 75</b><br>The success of entertainment properties for which we have a license, such as licenses we have with The Walt Disney Company, and the ability of us to successfully market and sell related products, can significantly affect our revenues and profitability. In some cases, we may only obtain an exclusive license for certain aspects of an IP or for certain territories, which means that some of our competitors also have the right to use the same IP for other categories or in different territories. If we produce a line of products based on a movie or television series, the success of the movie or series has a critical impact on the level of consumer interest in the associated products we are offering. In addition, competition in our industry for access to entertainment properties can lessen our ability to secure, maintain, and renew popular licenses to entertainment products on beneficial terms, if at all, and to attract and retain the talented employees necessary to design, develop and market successful products based on these properties. If we are unable to realize the full benefit of an important license, or if an important license is not renewed or is otherwise terminated, our business results may be harmed.<br><b>Paragraph 76</b><br>We cannot be certain that the products and offerings of companies we may acquire, or acquire an interest in, will achieve or maintain popularity with consumers in the future or that any such acquired companies or investments will allow us to more effectively market our products, develop our competencies or grow our business. In some cases, we expect that the integration of the companies that we may acquire into our operations will create production, marketing and other operating, revenue or cost synergies which will produce greater revenue growth and profitability and, where applicable, cost savings, operating efficiencies and other advantages. However, we cannot be certain that these synergies, efficiencies and cost savings will be realized. Even if achieved, these benefits may be delayed, reduced or short-lived in their realization. In other cases, we may acquire or invest in companies that we believe have strong and creative management, in which case we may plan to operate them more autonomously rather than fully integrating them into our operations. We cannot be certain that the key talented individuals at these companies would continue to work for us after the acquisition or that they would develop popular and profitable products, entertainment or services in the future. Acquisitions of businesses and brands could also be adversely affected by changes in our business strategy or external factors. For example, with our Blueprint strategy, we determined to sell, license or otherwise dispose of certain non-core assets, such as the recently completed sale of eOne Film and TV to Lionsgate. We cannot guarantee that any acquisition, disposition or investment we may make will be successful or beneficial, and acquisitions, dispositions and investments can consume significant amounts of management attention and other resources, which may negatively impact other aspects of our business.<br><b>Paragraph 77</b><br>Our dependence on third-party relationships with studios, content producers and distribution channels to develop and distribute digital games and entertainment content is critical to our business.<br><b>Paragraph 78</b><br>We rely on third party relationships with studios, content producers and distribution channels to develop and distribute certain digital games and entertainment content. Our financial performance may be adversely affected by our relationships with these studios, content producers and distribution channels. Some of our digital gaming developers and content producers are affiliates of major studios that develop their own games or content. Some have their own distribution capability in the markets in which we operate, and some may decide, or be required by their respective parent companies, to use their intra‑company distribution or content production capabilities rather than contracting with us. Our business may be harmed if the studios, content producers and distribution channels with which we work stop or reduce the amount of work they do with us or otherwise demand less favorable terms to us.<br><b>Paragraph 79</b><br>As a part of our transformation efforts to reduce costs, achieve operational efficiencies, and increase productivity and service quality, we have relied and expect to further rely on third-party vendor and outsourcing relationships for certain areas of the business. Working with third-parties for these critical areas subjects us to risk, including the reduction in full control over certain activities. Any failure to perform timely or accurately or other shortcoming of one of these vendors or outsourcers, could harm our business or could damage our reputation. Transitioning some of these services to a third-party outsourcing vendor is challenging and time-consuming. Problems with transitioning these services and systems to, or operating failures with, these vendors and outsourcers may cause delays to product sales and reduce the efficiency of our operations. We may not achieve the cost-savings we expect, and we may suffer knowledge loss and require significant capital investments to remediate the problem. We cannot guarantee that our outsourcing efforts will be successful.<br><b>Paragraph 80</b><br>Our officers and employees are at the heart of all our efforts. It is their skill, innovation and hard work that drive our success. We compete with many other potential employers in recruiting, hiring and retaining our management team and our many other skilled officers and employees around the world. In the digital gaming and entertainment industries, experienced personnel and top creative talent are in high demand and competition for their talent is intense. The continuing prevalence of remote and hybrid work creates further challenges in retaining employees as some employees desire more flexibility in their employment and the ability to work remotely or hybrid opens up more employment opportunities. Additionally, as we continue to transform our business to execute on our strategic plan, we have reduced our headcount and may otherwise lose employees due to our decision to eliminate or reduce the amount of work performed relative to non-core aspects of our business and the optimization of our business. The impact of reductions in workforce or failing to retain key employees can be high due to increased risk of loss of important information, key knowledge and relationships, loss of creative talent, lost productivity, hiring and training costs, all of which could result in lower profitability or otherwise harm the business. We cannot guarantee that we will recruit, hire or retain the key personnel we need to succeed.<br><b>Paragraph 81</b><br>We have experienced significant changes in our leadership in a relatively short period of time, with most key members of executive leadership having been appointed within the past couple of years. Our future success will depend on the leadership of our key executives and their ability to navigate the organization through our transformation efforts. Our loss of key management or other key employees, inability to drive success through our new leaders, or our inability to retain or hire talented people with the skill sets we need for our diverse and changing business, could significantly harm our business.<br><b>Paragraph 82</b><br>Partner Brands: The Partner Brands portfolio net revenues declined 35% in 2023 compared to 2022. Within the Partner Brands portfolio, there are a number of brands which are reliant on related entertainment, including movie and television releases. As such, net revenues fluctuate from year-to-year by brand, depending on entertainment popularity, release dates and the success of related product line offerings. Historically these entertainment-based brands experience higher revenues during years in which major films or television programming is released.<br><b>Paragraph 83</b><br>The summary that follows

included the impact of a favorable $2.9 million foreign currency translation. The net revenue increase in the Wizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming segment was primarily attributable to higher net revenues from DUNGEONS & DRAGONS digital gaming products, most notably Baldur's Gate 3, the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS-based role-playing video game released during the third quarter 2023 and to a lesser extent, higher digital licensing net revenues, attributable to the increased success of Monopoly Go!, as well as the launch of the Peppa Pig: World Adventures video game released in the first quarter of 2023. In addition, higher net revenues from Wizards of the Coast tabletop gaming products contributed to segment growth in 2023, most notably from MAGIC: THE GATHERING, driven by the success of the Lord of the Rings: Tales of Middle-earth card set released in June 2023.<br><b>Paragraph 86</b><br>In 2022, net revenues from the Wizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming segment increased 3% compared to 2021. The net revenue increase in the Wizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming segment was attributable to higher net revenues from Wizards of the Coast tabletop gaming products, most notably, MAGIC: THE GATHERING, which in 2022, became the Company's first billion-dollar brand, driven by the number of strong performing card sets released during the year. In total, 81% of segment net revenues were attributable to Wizards of the Coast tabletop games during 2022. The increase in tabletop gaming net revenues was partially offset by lower digital and licensed gaming net revenues, primarily from Magic: The Gathering Arena and from Dungeons & Dragons: Dark Alliance, launched during the first half of 2021 and to a lesser extent, lower net revenues from certain other of the Company's licensed digital games during 2022.<br><b>Paragraph 87</b><br>Entertainment segment net revenues declined 31% in 2023. compared to 2022 and included the impact of an unfavorable $4.3 million foreign currency translation. The net revenue decrease during 2023 was driven by lower entertainment productions and deliveries, reflecting the impact of the several months-long strikes during 2023 by the Writers Guild of America and the American actors' union, SAG-AFTRA. Notable programming that was delayed or cancelled included, Rookie seasons five and six, Rookie Feds season two, The Recruit season two, Yellowjackets season three and Cruel Summer season three. To a lesser extent, lower net revenues from unscripted programming contributed to the decrease reflecting the lower number of new deliveries during 2023 compared to 2022. Additionally, to a lesser extent, the strategic exit of certain non-core businesses during the fourth quarter of 2022 contributed to the decrease. These decreases were partially offset by higher net revenues from the Company's Family Brands business, from new agreements entered, and the renewal of certain existing streaming content agreements throughout 2023, related to programs featuring the Company's brands including the television series Power Rangers Cosmic Fury season 30, released on the Netflix streaming platform in September 2023.<br><b>Paragraph 88</b><br>Entertainment segment net revenues declined 17% in 2022 compared to 2021. The segment net revenue decrease primarily reflects the number of major film deliveries compared to 2021 where films such as Clifford The Big Red Dog, Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris and Come From Away were delivered, without a comparable number of major film deliveries in 2022, as well as lower net revenues from streaming content sales compared to 2021, which benefited from the September 2021 release of My Little Pony: A New Generation. To a lesser extent, lower transactional net revenues and lower net revenues from unscripted television deliveries compared to 2021 contributed to the decline. These decreases were partially offset by higher scripted television deliveries that include The Rookie seasons four and five, Cruel Summer season two, The Rookie: Feds season one and Yellowjackets season two.<br><b>Paragraph 89</b><br>The Entertainment segment operating loss was $1.9 billion, compared to operating profit of $22.7 million, or 2.4% of segment net revenues in 2022.<br><b>Paragraph 90</b><br>asset lite and partner led model, a loss on disposal of business of $539.0 million related to the sale of the eOne Film and TV business not directly supporting the Company's Entertainment Strategy, a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $231.2 million related to the goodwill impairment of the Company's Film & TV reporting unit, due to the expected economic impact of industry factors, as well as asset impairment charges of $65.0 million related to the Company's definite-lived intangible eOne Trademark. In addition to these charges, the Company recorded a $51.0 million intangible asset impairment charge related to the impairment of the Company's definite-lived PJ MASKS intangible asset due to challenging retail conditions and competitive market conditions leading to a reduction in brand profitability, and $19.4 million of intangible amortization costs recorded throughout 2023, related to certain intangible assets acquired in the eOne Acquisition. In addition to these charges, Entertainment segment operating losses were attributable to lower segment net revenues, due primarily to the impact of the writers' and actors' strikes mentioned above, which disrupted the number and timing of planned program productions and deliveries in 2023 compared to 2022, and higher program amortization costs due to production asset impairment charges associated with Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves and other cancelled projects, due to the Company's go-forward brand strategy. These increases were partially offset by lower operating expenses as a result of the exit of certain non-core businesses during the fourth quarter of 2022 and lower royalty expenses within the Company's film and TV business due to the volume and mix of content delivered during 2023, compared to 2022.<br><b>Paragraph 91</b><br>Entertainment segment operating profit was $22.7 million, or 2.4% of segment net revenues in 2022, compared to operating losses of $91.8 million, or 8.0% of segment net revenues in 2021.<br><b>Paragraph 92</b><br>◦Asset impairments and charges of $300.3 million of which $281.0 relates to the partial impairment of the Company's definite-lived Power Rangers intangible asset recorded in Selling, distribution and administration within the Corporate and Other segment, $14.9 million of incurred incremental asset charges recorded within Cost of sales related to product cancellations, consisting of inventory and asset write offs within the Consumer Products segment, and $4.4 million of strategy related asset impairments recorded within Program cost amortization, due to the cancellation of certain projects within the Entertainment segment; and<br><b>Paragraph 93</b><br>The Program cost amortization decrease during 2022 was driven by the volume and mix of programming revenues compared to 2021, partially offset by $4.1 million of asset impairment charges recorded during 2022, related to discontinued projects associated with the exit of non-core business within the Entertainment segment.<br><b>Paragraph 94</b><br>Royalty expense of $428.3 million, or 8.6% of net revenues, in 2023 compared to $493.0 million, or 8.4% of net revenues, in 2022 and $620.4 million, or 9.7% of net revenues, in 2021. Fluctuations in royalty expense generally relate to the volume of entertainment-driven products sold in a given period, especially if the Company is selling product tied to one or more major motion picture releases in the period. Product lines related to Hasbro-owned or controlled brands supported by entertainment generally do not incur the same level of royalty expense as licensed properties, particularly products for STAR WARS and MARVEL properties and certain other licensed properties which carry higher royalty rates than other licensed properties. In 2023, the decrease in royalty expense was primarily due to lower sales of certain Partner Brands products which carry higher royalty rates, driven in part by the exit of certain license agreements in December 2022, combined with lower royalty expense associated with the eOne Film & TV business as a result of the slowdown in production activity described above. These decreases to royalty expense were partially offset by the impact of royalty rates associated with the 2023 card set releases, Lord of the Rings: Tales of Middle-Earth and Doctor Who.<br><b>Paragraph 95</b><br>Advertising expense in 2023 totaled $358.4 million, or 7.2% of net revenues, compared to $387.3 million or 6.6% of net revenues in 2022 and $506.6 million or 7.9% in 2021. The level of the Company’s advertising expense is generally impacted by revenue mix, the amount and type of theatrical releases and television programming delivered. The advertising expense decrease during 2023 was driven by lower expense within the Consumer Products segment, due to the volume and mix of product sales and timing of advertising expenditures during 2023, partially offset by higher expense within the Entertainment and Wizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming segments, in support of the theatrical release of Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves and advertising costs associated with D&D Beyond, acquired during the second quarter of 2022.<br><b>Paragraph 96</b><br>The Advertising expense decrease during 2022 was driven by lower expense within the Consumer Products segment, reflecting the implementation of the Company's strategic shift to focus on fewer, bigger brands and lower advertising expense in the Entertainment segment related to the sale of the eOne Music business and a shift in the type of entertainment releases delivered in 2022. In 2021, higher advertising expense was driven by support for the September 2021 release of My Little Pony: A New Generation and within the Wizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming segment, expense in support of the 2021 launch of the mobile version of Magic: The Gathering Arena and Dungeons & Dragons: Dark Alliance, with no comparable releases in 2022.<br><b>Paragraph 97</b><br>In 2022, the Loss on disposal of business of $22.1 million, or 0.4% of net revenues represents non-cash impairment charges associated with the exit of certain non-core businesses within the Entertainment segment. The Loss on disposal of business of $108.8 million, or 1.7% of net revenues, represents a non-cash impairment charge associated with the disposition of eOne Music during 2021.<br><b>Paragraph 98</b><br>Cash Flow<br><b>Paragraph 99</b><br>The following table summarizes the changes in the consolidated statement of cash flows included in Part II, Item 8.

Ultimate revenue estimates impact the timing of program production cost amortization in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Ultimate revenue includes revenue from all sources that are estimated to be earned related to a film or television program and include theatrical exhibition; first run program distribution fees; toy, game and other consumer product licensing fees; and other revenue sources, such as secondary market home entertainment formats and subscription video on demand services. Our ultimate revenue estimates for each film or television program are developed based on our estimates of expected future results. We review and revise these estimates at each reporting date to reflect the most current available information. When estimates for a film or television program are revised, the difference between the program production cost amortization determined using the revised estimate and any amounts previously expensed during that fiscal year, are included as an adjustment to program production cost amortization in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the period in which the estimates are revised. Prior period amounts are not adjusted for subsequent changes in estimates. Factors that can impact our revenue estimates include the historical performance of similar films and television programs, expected distribution platforms, factors unique to our television and film

106</b><br>Revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods, intellectual property or production is transferred to the customers or licensees, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for transferring those goods. The Company accounts for a contract when it has approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance, and collectability of consideration is probable.<br><b>Paragraph 107</b><br>The Company enters into contracts to license its intellectual property, which consists of its brands, in various channels including but not limited to: consumer products such as apparel or home goods, within formats such as online and digital games, within venues such as theme parks, or within formats such as television and film. The licensees pay the Company either a sales-based or usage-based royalty, or a combination of both, for use of the brands, in some cases subject to minimum guaranteed amounts or fixed fees. The license of the Company’s brands provide access to the intellectual property over the term of the license, generally without any other performance obligation of the Company other than keeping the intellectual property active, and is therefore considered a right-to-access license of symbolic intellectual property. The Company records sales-based or usage-based royalty revenues for right-to-access licenses at the occurrence of the licensees’ subsequent sale or usage. When the arrangement includes a minimum guarantee, the Company records the minimum guarantee on a ratable basis over the term of the license period and does not record the sales-based or usage-based royalty revenues until they exceed the minimum guarantee.<br><b>Paragraph 108</b><br>The Company also produces, sells and licenses television and film content for distribution to third parties in formats that include broadcast, digital streaming, transactional and theatrical. These are intellectual property licenses where the licensees pay either a fixed fee for the content license or a variable fee in the form of a sales based royalty. The content that the Company delivers to its licensees typically has stand-alone functionality, generally without any other performance obligation of the Company, and is therefore considered a right-to-use license of functional intellectual property. The Company records revenues for right-to-use licenses once the license period has commenced and the licensee has the ability to use the delivered content. In arrangements where the licensee pays the Company a fixed fee for multiple seasons or multiple series of programming, arrangement fees are recorded as revenues based upon their relative fair values. The Company also earns advertising revenues from certain content made available on free to consumer, streaming video on demand platforms where the Company earns a portion of the advertising revenues earned by the service provider. The performance obligation is met and revenue is recorded when the user accesses the Company’s content through the streaming platform.<br><b>Paragraph 109</b><br>The Company develops and hosts digital games featuring its brands within the games, such as Magic: The Gathering Arena and D&D Beyond. The Company does not charge a fee to the end users for the download of the games or the ability to play the games. The end users make in-application purchases of virtual currencies, with such purchased virtual currencies to be used in the games. In addition, the Company offers a subscription service for D&D Beyond that provides access to a variety of added benefits, typically for a recurring monthly, semi-annual, or annual fee. The Company records revenues from in-application purchases based on either the usage patterns of the players or the player’s estimated life, depending on the nature of the game item purchased in exchange for virtual currency. For items recognized over the player's estimated life, the Company currently recognizes digital game's revenues ratably within six months of purchase, while revenue received from subscription services is<br><b>Paragraph 110</b><br>The Company incurs costs in connection with the production of television programming and live action movies. The majority of these costs are capitalized by the Company as they are incurred and amortized using the individual-film-forecast method, whereby these costs are amortized in the proportion that the current year’s revenues bear to management’s estimate of total ultimate revenues as of the beginning of such period related to the program. Ultimate revenue estimates are periodically reviewed and adjustments, if any, will result in changes to amortization rates and estimated accruals for residuals and participations. Ultimate revenue includes estimates over a period not to exceed ten years following the date of release of the production. Ultimate revenue used in amortization of acquired content rights is estimated over the life of the acquired rights but no longer than a period of ten years . These capitalized costs are reported at the lower of cost, less accumulated amortization, or fair value, and reviewed for impairment when an event or change in circumstances occurs that indicates that impairment may exist. The fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow model which is primarily based on management’s future revenue and cost estimates. Certain of these agreements require the Company to pay minimum guaranteed advances ("MGs") for participations and residuals. MGs are recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets when a liability arises, usually on delivery of the television or film program to the Company. The current portion of MGs are recorded as Payables and accrued liabilities and the long-term portion are recorded as Other liabilities. Substantially all of the Company’s non-Hasbro branded productions, and all of the Company's acquired content rights, were included with the eOne Film and TV business sold to Lionsgate in the fourth quarter of 2023. The Company retained all Hasbro-branded content and will continue to develop and produce animation, digital shorts, scripted TV and theatrical films for audiences related to core Hasbro IP.<br><b>Paragraph 111</b><br>In the ordinary course of business, the Company’s Consumer Products, Wizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming and Entertainment segments enter into contracts to license certain of the Company’s intellectual property, providing licensees right-to-use or access such intellectual property for use in the production and sale of consumer products and digital game development, and for use within content for distribution over streaming platforms and for television and film. The Company also licenses owned television and film content for distribution to third parties in formats that include broadcast, digital streaming and theatrical. Through these arrangements, the Company may receive advanced royalty payments from licensees, either in advance of a licensees’ subsequent sales to customers or, prior to the completion of the Company’s performance obligation. In addition, the Company’s Wizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming segment may receive advanced payments from end users of its digital games at the time of the initial purchase, through in-application purchases or through subscription services. These digital gaming revenues are recognized over a period of time, determined based on either player usage patterns or the estimated playing life of the user, or when additional downloadable content is made available, or as with subscription services, ratably over the subscription term. The Company defers revenues on all licensee and digital gaming advanced payments until the respective performance obligations are satisfied. The Company records the aggregate deferred revenues as contract liabilities, with the current portion recorded within Accrued liabilities and the long-term portion recorded as Other non-current liabilities in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company records contract assets, primarily related to (1) minimum guarantees being recognized in advance of contractual invoicing, which are recognized ratably over the terms of the respective license periods, and (2) film and television distribution revenues recorded for content delivered, where payment will occur over the license term. The current portion of contract assets is recorded in Prepaid expenses and Other current assets, respectively, and the long-term portion is recorded within Other long-term assets.<br><b>Paragraph 112</b><br>The Company disaggregates its revenues from contracts with customers by reportable segment: Consumer Products, Wizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming and Entertainment. The Company further disaggregates revenues within its Consumer Products segment by major geographic region: North America, Europe, Latin America, and Asia Pacific; within its Wizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming segment by category: Tabletop Gaming and Digital and Licensed Gaming; and within its Entertainment segment by category: Film & TV, Family Brands, and Other. Finally, the Company disaggregates its revenues by brand portfolio into four brand categories: Franchise Brands, Partner Brands, Portfolio Brands, and Non-Hasbro Branded Film & TV. We believe these collectively depict how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors. See note 21 for additional information on disaggregation of revenues.<br><b>Paragraph 113</b><br>Hasbro is a toy and game company with a broad portfolio of brands and entertainment content spanning toys, games, licensed products ranging from traditional to digital, as well as film and television entertainment. The Company's reportable segments are Consumer Products, Wizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming, Entertainment, and Corporate and Other.<br><b>Paragraph 114</b><br>The Consumer Products segment engages in the sourcing, marketing and sales of toy and game products around the world. The Consumer Products business also promotes the Company's brands through the out-licensing of our trademarks, characters and other brand and intellectual property rights to third parties, through the sale of branded consumer products such as toys and apparel. Additionally, through license agreements with third parties, we develop and sell products based on popular third-party brands. The Wizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming business engages in the promotion of the Company's brands through the development of trading card, role-playing and digital game experiences based on Hasbro and Wizards of the Coast games. Additionally, we out-license certain of our brands to other third-party digital game developers who transform Hasbro brand-based characters and other intellectual properties, into digital gaming experiences. The Entertainment segment engages in the development and production of Hasbro-branded entertainment content including film, television, children’s programming, digital content and live entertainment focused on Hasbro-owned properties.<br><b>Paragraph 115</b><br>Segment performance is measured at the operating profit level. Included in Corporate and Other are certain corporate expenses, including the elimination of intersegment transactions and certain assets benefiting more than one segment. Intersegment sales and transfers are reflected in management reports at amounts approximating cost. Certain shared costs, including global development and marketing expenses and corporate administration, are allocated to segments based upon expenses and foreign exchange rates fixed at the beginning of the year, with<br>
